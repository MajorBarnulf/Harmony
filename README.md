## Description

Harmony is a project about creating a simple messaging application client/server.
The project is still in very early development, features and technologies are still in debate.

We aim to provide a library for building custom clients and another one for servers.
Both with minimal feature set with a focus on high modding capacities.

## Disclaimer

This project is led by a group of student as a first experience with GIT project management on their free time.
If you are willing to contribute, please be indulgent with us.
